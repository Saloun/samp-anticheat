This project contains server-side anti-cheat and anti-flood solutions for GTA: San Andreas Multiplayer (http://sa-mp.com) written in the PAWN language.

**Feel free to contribute this site.**

This project's main goal is to make working filterscripts for beginners to avoid cheaters, flooders and spammers from their servers securely.

All filterscript inside this project is meant to be:

  1. Clean and fair source code, this means scripts doesn't increase server latency
  1. Prepared against packet loss. By this way players with network-related problems won't automatically marked as cheaters
  1. Easy to put inside any gamemodes - or with just some modifications in the filterscripts


All callbacks and information related to each filterscript can be found in the Wiki.
