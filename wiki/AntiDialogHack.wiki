#summary Anti Dialog Hack include - adh.inc

= Introduction =

Client could send fake OnDialogResponse callbacks to the server, with fake dialogid.
This include prevents this attack, every ShowPlayerDialog is tracked by the server and protects scripts when an OnDialogResponse fired.

= Usage=
`#include <adh>` in every script where you use either ShowPlayerDialog or OnDialogResponse (or both).

Added a simple function to get a player's current dialog: `GetPlayerDialogID(playerid);`
